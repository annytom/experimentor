# Actuators used in the experiment. They have to be grouped by the device to which they are connected.

NI-DAQ:
  Stage 1:
    port: 1
    type: analog
    mode: output
    description: Example analog Out
    calibration:
      units: um  # Target units, starting from volts. The calibration thus would be: device_value (true units) = slope*volts+offset
      slope: 1
      offset: 0
    limits:
      min: 0um
      max: 10um

# When working with devices connected through the serial or USB ports, defining actuators here simplify the tasks of building
# a GUI. Specifying limits here is useful for downstream code, and if the range is smaller than what the device actually
# supports it will be a limiting factor. However, there is low level control over which limits can or not be passed ot the
# real device. See the drivers folder for this.
