# Define and Configure the devices relevant to the experiment. Devices are only the ones communicating with a computer.
# For example an oscilloscope is a device. A photodiode connected to an oscilloscope is a sensor, a piezo stage connected
# to a DAQ card is an actuator.
# The Main key of the device has to be unique. As you can see with the two oscilloscopes, they have the same name, but
# Their main key is different and the notes are different.
# Whatever parameter is added, will be saved in the metadata. Therefore, even if maybe not relevant to the experiment,
# it can be useful for traceability. As an example: the Santec laser does not need to have the model defined for it to
# work, but it can be useful to store that information. There can also be notes, for example see the oscilloscope.

TSL-710:
  type: scan laser
  name: Santec Laser
  driver: experimentor.drivers.santec.tsl710/tsl710 # last one is the name of the class inside the file.
  model: TSL-710
  connection:
    type: GPIB
    port: 1

NI-DAQ:
  name: NI-DAQ
  type: daq
  model: ni
  number: 2
  driver: experimentor.models.daq.ni/ni
  connection:
    type: daq
    port: 2
  trigger: external
  trigger_source: PFI0

oscilloscope:
  type: daq
  driver: experimentor.model.daq.keysight
  name: Keysight oscilloscope
  trigger: external
  trigger_source: 1 # This is only for example purposes!
  connection:
    type: USB
    port: 1
  notes: The port number 2 of this oscilloscope doesn't work. I was using the oscilloscope labeled as OSC2.

oscilloscope 2:
  type: daq
  driver: experimentor.model.daq.keysight
  name: Keysight oscilloscope
  connection:
    type: USB
    port: 2
  notes: This oscilloscope works fine.

DummyDaq:
  type: daq
  name: dummy daq
  driver: experimentor.model.daq.daqDummy/dummyDaq
  connection:
    type: daq
    port: 1
  defaults: config/devices_defaults.yml
  trigger: external
  trigger_source: PFI0
